	\begin{itemize}
		\item[] This project is a combination of information security and application development which is of great interest to me. Information security is a well known topic being discussed today as every person, business and government wants their information to be secure. Not to mention a person eavesdropping on a conversation that was supposed to be secure. Thus I would like to partake in this project.
